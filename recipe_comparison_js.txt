Ex2: Display 2 recipes side by side
Load recipe_page.html directly into a table so recipes sided by side

When loading file recipe_page.html  Error occurs: file not from local origin
	Solution run a webserver to serve the files locally

	Solutions in Node.js, python, ruby, PHP, on GitHub on StackOverflow
		python3 -m http.server					# start web server in directory
		http://0.0.0.0:8000/recipe_page.html	# access through browser
		http://localhost:8000/recipe_page.html

	OK webserver is serving pages but still getting error:
		from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
		For production fix, CORS headers has to be added to the backend server to allow cross origin access.

	Solution, install node.js and npm then http-server and run it with the â€”cors argument so it adds headers


As follows:
local/directory/path$ brew install node

local/directory/path$ node -v
v11.10.1

local/directory/path$ npm -v
6.7.0

local/directory/path$ npm install http-server -g
/usr/local/bin/hs -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
/usr/local/bin/http-server -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
+ http-server@0.11.1
added 26 packages from 28 contributors in 2.374s

local/directory/path$ cd /Users/lang/html_css_js/repos/html_label 

/repos/html_label$ http-server -p 8000 --cors

Servers up and running with the added benefit of serving on the local network.
